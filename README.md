# Software Architecture Diagrams with Mermaid

This repository provides a collection of software architecture diagrams generated with Mermaid and assisted by GitHub Copilot in VS Code.

The goal is to offer clear, well-documented, and reusable diagrams that illustrate different possible software architecture styles and patterns. These diagrams can serve as educational material, technical documentation, or reference models for real-world projects.

## Key Features

- Multiple architecture models: monolithic, layered, client-server, microservices, event-driven, serverless, hexagonal, cloud-native, and more.
- Mermaid-based diagrams: human-readable, easy to edit, and integrable into markdown documentation.
- Copilot-assisted generation: prompts and code examples demonstrate how GitHub Copilot can automate and accelerate the creation of architecture diagrams.
- Well-documented examples: every diagram includes comments that explain the roles of components and their interactions.
- Consistency and clarity: components use explicit, descriptive names (e.g., `Web Client`, `API Gateway`, `Authentication Service`, `PostgreSQL Database`).
- Comparison of alternatives: side-by-side visualization of different architectures to highlight trade-offs and design choices.

## Example

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  %% Legend / Title (use legend instead of 'title' for broad compatibility)
  subgraph Legend
    direction TB
    T[Title: Microservices with API Gateway]
  end

    A[Web Client] --> B[API Gateway]
    B --> C[Authentication Service]
    B --> D[Product Catalog Service]
    C --> E[(User Database)]
    D --> F[(Product Database)]

%% Explanation:
%% - The Web Client interacts with the API Gateway.
%% - The API Gateway routes requests to microservices.
%% - The Authentication Service manages secure access.
%% - The Product Catalog Service handles product-related data.
%% - Each service manages its own database (database-per-service pattern).
```

## How to use

- Open this repository with VS Code.
- Ensure you have the recommended extensions installed (see `.vscode/extensions.json`).
- Open any `.md` file and preview Mermaid diagrams:
  - Right-click the editor â†’ "Open Preview"
  - Or use: Ctrl+Shift+V (Windows) for Markdown preview; some Mermaid previews may require the Mermaid extension's preview command.

## Structure

- `diagrams/`: Mermaid diagram files grouped by architecture style
