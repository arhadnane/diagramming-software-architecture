# Software Architecture Diagrams with Mermaid

This repository provides a curated collection of software architecture diagrams generated with Mermaid and assisted by GitHub Copilot in VS Code.

The goal is to offer clear, well-documented, and reusable diagrams that illustrate modern architecture styles and patterns. Use them as educational material, technical documentation, starting points for whiteboarding sessions, or reference models for real-world projects.

## Key Features

- Multiple architecture models: monolithic, layered, client-server, microservices, event-driven, serverless, hexagonal, cloud-native, and more.
- Mermaid-based diagrams: human-readable, easy to edit, and integrable into markdown documentation.
- Copilot-assisted generation: prompts and code examples demonstrate how GitHub Copilot can automate and accelerate the creation of architecture diagrams.
- Well-documented examples: every diagram includes comments that explain the roles of components and their interactions.
- Consistency and clarity: components use explicit, descriptive names (e.g., `Web Client`, `API Gateway`, `Authentication Service`, `PostgreSQL Database`).
- Comparison of alternatives: side-by-side visualization of different architectures to highlight trade-offs and design choices.

## Example

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  %% Legend / Title (use legend instead of 'title' for broad compatibility)
  subgraph Legend
    direction TB
    T[Title: Microservices with API Gateway]
  end

    A[Web Client] --> B[API Gateway]
    B --> C[Authentication Service]
    B --> D[Product Catalog Service]
    C --> E[(User Database)]
    D --> F[(Product Database)]

%% Explanation:
%% - The Web Client interacts with the API Gateway.
%% - The API Gateway routes requests to microservices.
%% - The Authentication Service manages secure access.
%% - The Product Catalog Service handles product-related data.
%% - Each service manages its own database (database-per-service pattern).
```

## Quick start

1. Clone the repository and open it in VS Code.
2. Install the recommended extensions (VS Code will prompt from `.vscode/extensions.json`).
3. Open any diagram file (under `diagrams/`) and press `Ctrl+Shift+V` to preview it. If you use the Mermaid extension, run the "Markdown: Open Preview to the Side" command for live updates.
4. Tweak the Mermaid code and re-run the preview to iterate quickly.

## Generate new diagrams with Copilot

Prompts in `prompts/copilot-prompts.md` help Copilot produce consistent Mermaid diagrams. Copy a prompt, replace placeholders (architecture style, domain, constraints), and ask Copilot to expand it in a Markdown file. Each prompt enforces explicit component names, inline comments, and optional variants so the output matches the rest of this catalog.

## Structure

- `diagrams/`: Mermaid diagram files grouped by architecture style
- `prompts/`: Copilot prompt templates to generate/extend diagrams
- `.vscode/`: recommended extensions for better authoring experience
